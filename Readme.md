Slot Machine Game


Introduction


The Slot Machine Game is a simple text-based Python game that simulates a slot machine. Players can bet on multiple lines and try their luck to win coins based on the symbols they land on the slot machine.

How to Play
Setup: To play the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Download the main.py file and run it using the Python interpreter.

Deposit: Upon starting the game, the player will be prompted to deposit an initial balance. Enter a positive integer as the amount you want to start with.

Placing Bets: The game allows you to bet on multiple lines. You will be asked to choose the number of lines you want to bet on (between 1 and 3) and the bet amount for each line (between $1 and $100).

Spinning the Reels: After placing your bets, the slot machine reels will be spun. The machine will randomly generate symbols for each column and row, displaying the result.

Checking Winnings: The game will then check for any winning combinations based on the symbols and bet amount. If you win, your total winnings will be calculated, and the game will display the winning lines.

Updating Balance: Your balance will be updated according to your total winnings or losses from the bet. The game will show your current balance after each spin.

Keep Playing: You can continue playing as long as you like. To play another round, just press Enter. If you want to quit, type 'q' and press Enter.

Rules
The game uses four different symbols: A, B, C, and D. Each symbol has a corresponding count and value.
The player can bet on 1 to 3 lines and choose the bet amount for each line.
The game will check for winning combinations on each line separately.
To win on a line, you need to have the same symbol on all three columns of that line.
If you win, your winnings will be calculated as the product of the symbol value and the bet amount for the winning line.
If you lose the bet, your balance will be decreased by the total bet amount.
The game will prevent you from betting more than your current balance.
After each round, the player's remaining balance will be displayed.

Customization

You can customize the game by changing the constants at the beginning of the main.py file. You can adjust the maximum and minimum bet amounts, the number of lines, and the number of columns in the slot machine.

Additionally, you can modify the symbols, their counts, and values by updating the symbol_count and symbol_value dictionaries in the code.

Enjoy the Game!
Have fun playing the Slot Machine Game! Test your luck, aim for winning combinations, and see how much you can win. Good luck, and may the symbols be in your favor!
